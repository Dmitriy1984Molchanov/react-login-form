# React.js Challenge - Login Form
You have multiple clients who all need login forms, sooner rather than later. To make all of them
happy, youâ€™re to build a reusable login form component with React.
Your login form component must satisfy the following criteria:
- It must be a React component
- It has a text field for users to type in their username
- It has a text field for users to type in their password
- It has a login button for users to click
- Because this login form will be used by your many different clients, you need to be able to let
them specify what should happen when users click the login button.
